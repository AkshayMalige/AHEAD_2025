# AHEAD Example Project: Vector Addition

# AHEAD Workshop Project

Welcome to the AHEAD FPGA workshop! This repository contains a complete step-by-step guided project for learning Vitis HLS, kernel integration, host code development, and system project building.

---

## 🧭 Structure

This repository is split into multiple stages:

- **[Part 1](./part1.md):** Vitis Flow 101 – Part 1: Essential Concepts 
- **[Part 2](./part2.md):** Environment Setup
- **[Part 3](./part3.md):** Review the Kernel Code and Host Application
- **[Part 4](./part4.md):** Creating an example HLS component on Vitis Unified, Optimizations & Reviwing reports
- **[Part 5](./part5.md):** Creating Application Component and System Project

Each part builds on the previous and is designed to be clear and reproducible.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Start by following [part1.md](./part1.md) to set up your environment and clone the repository.

From there, proceed to part2.md and part3.md and so on in order.
