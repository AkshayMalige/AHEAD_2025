# AHEAD Example Project: Vector Addition

# AHEAD Workshop Project

Welcome to the AHEAD FPGA workshop! This repository contains a complete step-by-step guided project for learning Vitis HLS, kernel integration, host code development, and system project building.

---

## 🧭 Structure

This repository is split into multiple stages:

- **[Part 1](./part1.md):** Environment setup and project checkout
- **[Part 2](./part2.md):** Creating and running the HLS component
- **[Part 3](./part3.md):** Building the host and system project

Each part builds on the previous and is designed to be clear and reproducible.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Start by following [part1.md](./part1.md) to set up your environment and clone the repository.

From there, proceed to part2.md and part3.md in order.
